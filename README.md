# Slicer Menu Library

Originally found this library on github, it appeared to now longer work due to being outdated. I decided to revive it for library building experience and because I love menu animation.

{Original Library by Yalantis](https://github.com/Yalantis/GuillotineMenu-Android)

Feel free to contribute and suggest updates.
